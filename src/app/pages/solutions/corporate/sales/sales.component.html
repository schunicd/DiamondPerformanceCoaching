        A seasoned salesperson will tell you that sales is just as much about relationship building as it is about a product or service. Today’s marketplace has more competition and choice than ever, so salespeople need an edge to make them stand out from the crowd.

          How Personality Dimensions can help with your Sales Team
        </h3>
        <p>
          Personality Dimensions® helps salespeople adapt their approach so they can have a greater impact on their customers, leading to more successful interactions. By developing their Personality Radar™, salespeople are able to get right to addressing the goals, needs and wants of their clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          It starts with self-awareness; understanding your own values, needs, and wants gives you insight into how and why you work the way you do. This gives a foundation of awareness that can be immediately used to build relationships. The next step is understanding the values, needs, and wants of other unique personalities, and learning how to identify them by their visual, spoken, and written cues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Personality Dimensions® can be easily tied into existing sales training programs; it doesn’t replace what you already do best, it helps you understand your customer better so you can start the relationship off right.
